const text1 = "The possibility of their mother dating and having sex had made Trevor’s head explode. He hadn’t simply been a little squicked out—no, he seemed to think it was wrong for her to date, though he refused to say why, and Lindsay had spent many minutes trying to explain, in her patient big‑sister voice, that there was nothing wrong with this, but perhaps he and Mom should establish some, uh, rules. And though, in theory, she was glad her mom was dating, she was still uneasy about the whole thing, but she hadn’t told Trevor about this.";

Good‑looking guys weren’t precisely a dime a dozen, but there were many, and she’d enjoyed one—in much closer proximity than this—in the past month: she’d hooked up with a man she’d met at Noreen’s wedding. So it wasn’t like she’d had a long dry spell, though perhaps her sex life wasn’t as active as her mother’s . . .";

Then she’s older, eyes alight with a different kind of love as she holds out a bowl of rice and peppered catfish. With shining dark skin and a wide smile, the man before her is beautiful. I feel her heart lift as he takes the food and their fingers brush. Later, she’s tilling a small field next to a village. Fingers sprinkling seeds into the grooves she’s created in the earth, as she sings a song to Oko, the orisa of crops. Her voice is sweet and high, rising with the heat of the day. And then she’s holding a baby with the same grin as hers. She presses her face into the folds of the girl’s neck, inhaling the child’s milky scent. I smile, feeling all the jubilation she has felt and the love that fills her soul.";
